# Nodal-Analysis-and-Regulation-Circuit-NARC-

DISCLAIMER: Development work was versioned internally, this is the final version of my contributions to the project. All sensitive data/code has been removed and I 
received permission from my supervisors prior to publishing this.

Overview: This was the primary focus of my eight month co-op with Teck Resources Ltd. The purpose of this device was a remote voltage and current monitoring system 
communicating to an influx database over MQTT. Further code was added to allow reconfiguration of network parameters remotely and a symmetric multiprocessing approach was implemented to 
streamline sampling and communication procedures stimultaneously. The two pictures included below showcase this functionality graphically.

I hope you enjoy my work
